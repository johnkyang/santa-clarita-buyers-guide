Welcome to our first monthly market report of 2025! As we enter the new year, the Santa Clarita Valley real estate market shows interesting trends that both buyers and sellers should understand.

## Market Overview

## What's Driving the Market?

### 1. Interest Rates Stabilizing

After peaking in late 2024, interest rates have settled in the **6.5-7.0% range** for 30-year fixed mortgages. While still elevated compared to 2020-2021, this stability is helping buyers plan with confidence.

### 2. CalHFA Dream For All Returns

The CalHFA Dream For All program is expected to reopen in **early 2026** with a new lottery system. First-generation homebuyers are preparing now to be ready when registration opens.

### 3. New Construction Activity

Several major developments are underway:
- **Valencia**: 250 new homes planned in North Valencia
- **Castaic**: Lake View Terrace adding 180 units
- **Stevenson Ranch**: 75 luxury homes breaking ground Q2 2025

### 4. Low Inventory Persists

With only **2.1 months of inventory**, Santa Clarita remains firmly in seller's market territory. A balanced market typically has 4-6 months of inventory.

## Buyer's Market Analysis

### What This Means for Buyers

**Opportunities:**
- More time to view homes (32 days on market)
- Less frequent bidding wars than 2023
- Sellers more willing to negotiate on repairs/concessions

**Challenges:**
- Still limited inventory overall
- Need strong pre-approval to compete
- Premium neighborhoods still see multiple offers

### Best Strategies for January 2025 Buyers

1. **Get Pre-Approved Early**: Work with a CalHFA-approved lender if eligible for down payment assistance
2. **Be Ready to Move Fast**: Even with slower market, good homes still go quickly
3. **Focus on Value**: Newhall, Canyon Country, and Castaic offer the most affordability
4. **Consider New Construction**: Builders are offering incentives to move inventory
5. **Don't Wait for Perfect**: Interest rates unlikely to drop significantly in Q1 2025

## Price Predictions for 2025

Based on current trends, we predict:

- **Overall appreciation**: 3-5% for the year
- **Inventory levels**: Expect slight increase in spring
- **Interest rates**: Range between 6.0-7.5% throughout the year
- **First-time buyer activity**: Increase when CalHFA reopens

## Conclusion

The Santa Clarita market is entering 2025 in a position of stability. While it remains a seller's market due to low inventory, buyers have more breathing room than they did in 2022-2023.

For buyers preparing to purchase this year:
- Start your pre-approval process now
- Research CalHFA and down payment assistance programs
- Tour neighborhoods to understand value differences
- Work with a local expert who knows Santa Clarita
