# CalHFA Dream For All 2026: What First-Generation Homebuyers Need to Know Now

The CalHFA Dream For All program is making a comeback in **early 2026** with significant changes. If you're a first-generation homebuyer in Santa Clarita, here's what you need to know to prepare.

## What's Changing in 2026?

### New Lottery System (Not First-Come, First-Served!)

Unlike previous rounds where vouchers were claimed instantly, the 2026 program will use a **randomized drawing system**:

1. **Registration Period**: A specific window (likely 2-4 weeks) when applicants can register
2. **Random Selection**: Computer lottery selects voucher recipients
3. **Equal Opportunity**: Everyone who registers during the window has an equal chance

**Why this matters:** You won't need to refresh a website at midnight. Take your time to prepare properly!

## Program Benefits (Unchanged)

- **Up to 20% assistance** for down payment or closing costs
- **Maximum $150,000** in assistance
- **No interest** and **no monthly payment**
- **Appreciation share** when you sell or refinance

### Example: Valencia Home Purchase

\`\`\`
Home Price: $900,000
Dream For All Assistance: $150,000 (16.7%)
Your Down Payment Needed: $30,000 (3.5% FHA)
Total Down Payment: $180,000 (20%)
\`\`\`

## Eligibility Requirements

### Must-Have Qualifications

✅ **First-Generation Homebuyer**
- At least one borrower's parents never owned a home
- Most common reason for disqualification - verify carefully!

✅ **California Resident**
- One borrower must be a current CA resident

✅ **First-Time Homebuyer**
- All borrowers must not have owned a home in the past 3 years

✅ **Income Limits**
- Must meet CalHFA income limits for your county
- Los Angeles County (Santa Clarita): See [income limits](/down-payment-assistance)

## How to Prepare NOW

### Step 1: Verify First-Generation Status

**Document your parents' homeownership history:**
- Get their full legal names
- Date of birth
- Current address
- Proof of relationship (birth certificate, adoption papers)

**If parent is deceased:**
- Date of death
- Death certificate may be required

### Step 2: Get Pre-Approved by Dream For All Lender

**Critical**: You must have a pre-approval from a CalHFA-approved lender BEFORE the registration period.

**What you'll need:**
- 2 years of tax returns
- 2 months of bank statements
- Recent pay stubs
- Credit report (minimum 660 score recommended)
- Government ID
- Gift letter (if using gift funds)

[Find CalHFA-approved lenders](/contact) in Santa Clarita.

### Step 3: Understand the Timeline

**Expected 2026 Timeline:**

- **Q1 2026**: Program announcement and registration dates revealed
- **Registration Period**: 2-4 week window (exact dates TBA)
- **Lottery Draw**: 1-2 weeks after registration closes
- **Voucher Validity**: 120 days to find a home and get into contract
- **Closing Deadline**: 180 days from voucher issue

**Action item:** Mark your calendar and set alerts when CalHFA announces dates!

### Step 4: Start House Hunting Research

Don't wait for the voucher! Start researching now:

**Santa Clarita Neighborhoods for Dream For All Buyers:**

**Best Value Options:**
- **Newhall**: $725K median, excellent downtown walkability
- **Canyon Country**: $715K median, family-friendly
- **Castaic**: $700K median, lake access

**Mid-Range Options:**
- **Saugus**: $795K median, top schools
- **Valencia**: $950K median, master-planned amenities

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ Waiting Until Registration Opens

**Problem**: Lender pre-approvals take 2-4 weeks

**Solution**: Get pre-approved NOW. When registration opens, you'll be ready.

### ❌ Not Having Parent Information Ready

**Problem**: Gathering parent documentation can take weeks

**Solution**: Collect all required parent information now. If parents are uncooperative, start working with your lender on alternative documentation.

### ❌ Assuming You Qualify

**Problem**: Finding out during registration that you don't qualify

**Solution**: Meet with a Dream For All lender now to verify eligibility

### ❌ Not Saving for Down Payment

**Problem**: Even with $150K assistance, you need 3.5% FHA down

**Solution**: Start saving now. On a $750K home, you need $26,250 out of pocket.

## What If You Don't Get Selected?

If the lottery doesn't select you, don't give up! You have options:

### Alternative Down Payment Assistance Programs

**CalHFA MyHome Assistance**
- 3.5% assistance (up to $15,000)
- Available for first-time buyers
- No lottery system

## Success Stories

**Their strategy:**
