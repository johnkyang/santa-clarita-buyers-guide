**Age Restrictions**: To qualify as a 55+ community, at least 80% of homes must have one resident who is 55 or older. Some communities require all residents to be 55+, while others allow a percentage of residents aged 45-54.

**Community Types in Santa Clarita**:
- **Active Adult Communities**: Larger developments with extensive amenities, social programs, and activities
- **55+ Neighborhoods**: Smaller sections within larger master-planned communities
- **Manufactured Home Communities**: More affordable options with monthly space rent
- **Condominium/Townhome Communities**: Lock-and-leave convenience with minimal maintenance

**What Makes Them Different**:
- Age restrictions create quieter, more mature environments
- Amenities and activities designed for active adults
- Often single-story or elevator-equipped buildings
- HOAs typically handle exterior maintenance
- Social calendars with events, clubs, and classes
- Enhanced security and gated access in many communities`,

**Safety & Security**: Many communities offer gated access, security patrols, and emergency response systems. The active, involved nature of residents creates natural neighborhood watch.

**Financial Predictability**: HOA fees cover many services, making monthly costs more predictable. No surprise expenses for exterior repairs or landscaping.

**Downsizing Benefits**: Move from a large family home to a right-sized space that's easier to maintain, heat, cool, and navigate as you age.

**Age-Appropriate Design**: Homes often include wider doorways, fewer stairs, accessible showers, and lever-style door handles—features that increase comfort and safety.`,

      question: 'Can my adult children or grandchildren visit and stay overnight?',
      answer:
        'Yes, but there are typically limitations. Most 55+ communities allow guests of any age to visit and stay for limited periods (often 2-4 weeks per year total). Holiday visits are generally acceptable. However, communities prohibit permanent residents under age restrictions. Review specific community rules as they vary.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What happens if I become ill or need assisted living?',
      answer:
        '55+ communities are independent living, not assisted living or skilled nursing facilities. If you need significant medical care, you\'ll need to arrange outside services or transition to an assisted living facility. However, many residents successfully age in place with the help of in-home care services. Consider purchasing long-term care insurance to cover future needs.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Are 55+ homes harder to sell?',
      answer:
        'In Santa Clarita\'s market, well-maintained homes in quality 55+ communities typically sell well due to strong demand from baby boomers. However, your buyer pool is limited to age-qualified buyers. Work with agents experienced in 55+ communities who know how to market to active adult buyers. Price competitively and highlight community amenities.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What if one spouse is under 55?',
      answer:

However, communities with strict 55+ requirements (all occupants must be 55+) exist but are less common. Review specific community rules before purchasing.',
