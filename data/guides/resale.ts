  introduction:
    'Resale homes—existing properties being sold by current owners—make up the majority of Santa Clarita\'s housing market. These homes offer unique advantages including established neighborhoods, mature landscaping, and often more square footage per dollar compared to new construction. This guide will help you navigate the resale market, from identifying the right property to closing the deal on your Santa Clarita home.',

      title: 'Advantages of Buying Resale Homes',
      content: `Resale homes offer compelling benefits for many buyers:

**Established Neighborhoods**: Move into communities with mature trees, established neighbor relationships, and proven school assignments. You can see exactly what the neighborhood looks like rather than imagining future development.

**Better Value Per Square Foot**: Resale homes often offer more space for your money compared to new construction. Older homes frequently feature larger lots, bigger floor plans, and more storage space.

**Character & Unique Features**: Many resale homes have architectural details, mature landscaping, and character that's difficult to replicate in new construction. Custom upgrades from previous owners may provide value without additional cost.

**Immediate Availability**: No waiting for construction to complete. Once you close, you can move in immediately. This is ideal if you're relocating for work or need to transition quickly from a rental.

**Negotiation Opportunities**: Unlike new construction with fixed pricing, resale homes offer more room for negotiation on price, repairs, closing costs, and included items.

**Known Costs**: HOA fees, utility costs, and maintenance needs are established and verifiable. Previous owners can share actual expenses rather than estimates.

**Location Choices**: Access to highly desirable, established areas where new construction may not be available, including central Valencia, older Saugus neighborhoods, and historic Newhall.`,

      title: 'The Home Inspection Process',
      content: `Professional home inspections are crucial for resale purchases:

**Why Inspections Matter**: Resale homes may have hidden issues, deferred maintenance, or aging systems. A thorough inspection reveals problems before you commit to purchase, providing leverage for negotiations or the ability to walk away.

**What Inspectors Examine**:
- Roof condition and remaining lifespan
- Foundation and structural integrity
- HVAC systems, water heater, and major appliances
- Plumbing systems and visible leaks
- Electrical systems and safety hazards
- Windows, doors, and weather sealing
- Drainage and grading issues

**Specialized Inspections**: Depending on the home, you may need additional inspections for:
- Pest/termite inspection (often required by lenders)
- Sewer line camera inspection
- Pool and spa systems
- Septic system (if applicable)
- Chimney inspection
- Mold testing

**Using Inspection Results**:
- Request repairs for significant issues
- Negotiate price reduction for needed work
- Ask for seller credits to handle repairs yourself
- Understand which issues are deal-breakers vs. minor concerns
- Get cost estimates for major repairs before negotiating

**Santa Clarita Specific Concerns**:
- Foundation issues due to expansive soil in some areas
- HVAC efficiency for hot summer months
- Irrigation systems and drought-tolerant landscaping
- HOA-maintained vs. homeowner-maintained items`,

      title: 'Making Competitive Offers',
      content: `In Santa Clarita's competitive market, strategic offers win:

**Research Comparable Sales**: Before writing an offer, review recent sales of similar homes in the neighborhood. This provides justification for your offer price and helps gauge market value.

**Understanding Market Conditions**:
- Seller's market: Multiple offers, properties sell quickly, often above asking
- Buyer's market: Homes sit longer, sellers more flexible, below-asking offers accepted
- Balanced market: Offers at or near asking price, reasonable negotiation possible

**Offer Components**:
- **Purchase Price**: Based on comps, condition, and market competition
- **Earnest Money Deposit**: Typically 1-3% of purchase price, shows commitment
- **Contingencies**: Inspection, appraisal, loan approval (fewer contingencies strengthen offer)
- **Timeline**: Close of escrow period (shorter can be attractive to sellers)
- **Included Items**: Appliances, window coverings, storage sheds, etc.

**Strengthening Your Offer**:
- Pre-approval letter from reputable lender (required)
- Larger earnest money deposit
- Proof of funds for down payment
- Flexible closing timeline to match seller needs
- Personal letter to sellers (can be effective in emotional situations)
- Limiting contingencies (only if you're comfortable with the risk)
- Escalation clause in multiple-offer situations

**Negotiation Strategies**:
- Know your maximum price before you start
- Don't lowball in competitive markets—it can backfire
- Be prepared to walk away if terms don't meet your needs
- Work collaboratively with sellers when possible
- Understand seller motivations (quick sale, highest price, certainty of close, etc.)`,

      id: 'escrow-closing',
      title: 'Escrow & Closing Process',
      content: `Understanding escrow ensures a smooth path to ownership:

**Opening Escrow**: Once your offer is accepted, escrow opens at a neutral third-party company. They hold funds and documents, ensuring all conditions are met before transferring ownership.

**Typical Timeline** (30-45 days):
- Days 1-7: Earnest money deposited, inspections scheduled
- Days 7-17: Complete inspections, request repairs, finalize loan application
- Days 17-21: Appraisal conducted, review title report
- Days 21-30: Loan underwriting, final walk-through
- Days 30-45: Sign closing documents, fund loan, record deed

**Key Escrow Steps**:
1. **Deposit Earnest Money**: Typically within 3 days of acceptance
2. **Review Preliminary Title Report**: Ensure clean title with no liens or issues
3. **Complete Inspections**: Usually 10-17 day inspection period
4. **Negotiate Repairs**: Based on inspection findings
5. **Finalize Financing**: Submit all documents to lender
6. **Home Appraisal**: Lender orders appraisal to confirm value
7. **Final Walk-Through**: Verify property condition before closing
8. **Sign Closing Documents**: Usually 1-2 days before recording
9. **Funding & Recording**: Loan funds and deed records with county
10. **Receive Keys**: Typically same day or day after recording

**Closing Costs to Expect** (2-5% of purchase price):
- Loan origination fees and points
- Appraisal and inspection fees
- Title insurance and escrow fees
- Property taxes and HOA prorations
- Homeowners insurance premium
- Recording fees and transfer taxes

**Santa Clarita Considerations**:
- Most transactions use title companies like Fidelity or First American
- Property taxes in Santa Clarita are typically 1.1-1.3% of purchase price annually
- HOA transfer fees vary by community ($200-$500+)
- Natural Hazard Disclosure reports required for all properties`,

      title: 'Common Mistakes to Avoid',
      content: `Learn from others' experiences to ensure a smooth purchase:

**Getting Emotionally Attached Too Early**: Fall in love with a home after the inspection, not before. Emotional attachment clouds judgment and can lead to overpaying or overlooking serious issues.

**Waiving Inspections**: Even in competitive markets, try to maintain inspection rights. If you must waive contingencies to compete, at least conduct a pre-offer inspection to understand what you're buying.

**Maxing Out Your Budget**: Leave financial cushion for unexpected repairs, improvements, and moving costs. Just because you're approved for a certain amount doesn't mean you should spend it all.

**Ignoring Resale Value**: Buy with your future sale in mind. Properties near good schools, with desirable features, and in well-maintained neighborhoods hold value better.

**Skipping the Final Walk-Through**: Always conduct a final walk-through 24-48 hours before closing to ensure agreed-upon repairs were completed and nothing has changed.

**Not Reading Everything**: Review all disclosures, HOA documents, inspection reports, and closing documents carefully. Ask questions about anything unclear.

**Forgetting About Moving Costs**: Budget for movers, deposits for utilities, immediate repairs or improvements, and time off work for the move.

**Poor Communication**: Stay in regular contact with your agent, lender, and escrow officer. Delayed responses can jeopardize your timeline and cause unnecessary stress.`,

      question: 'How much should I offer on a resale home in Santa Clarita?',
      answer:
        'Your offer should be based on recent comparable sales, current market conditions, property condition, and days on market. In a balanced market, offers typically range from 95-100% of asking price. Your agent will provide a comparative market analysis to support your offer strategy. In competitive situations, you may need to offer at or above asking price.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What\'s a normal amount for repairs on a resale home?',
      answer:
        'Expect to find some repair items on any resale home. Typical inspection reports identify $2,000-$10,000 in recommended repairs and maintenance. Major issues (roof replacement, foundation problems, HVAC replacement) can run $10,000-$50,000+. Use inspection findings to negotiate repairs, credits, or price reductions with the seller.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Should I buy a fixer-upper or a turnkey home?',
      answer:
        'This depends on your budget, skills, time, and risk tolerance. Fixer-uppers offer potential savings and customization but require renovation expertise, additional financing, and time to complete work. Turnkey homes cost more upfront but allow immediate occupancy and predictable expenses. Consider renovation costs carefully—they often exceed initial estimates.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How long does it take to close on a resale home?',
      answer:
        'Typical escrow periods in Santa Clarita are 30-45 days, though all-cash purchases can close in as little as 14 days. Factors affecting timeline include loan type (FHA/VA take longer), appraisal scheduling, inspection negotiations, and title issues. Work with experienced professionals to stay on track.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What if the appraisal comes in low?',
      answer:
        'If the appraisal is below your contract price, you have several options: negotiate a lower price with the seller, increase your down payment to make up the difference, request a reconsideration of value with additional comps, or cancel the contract if you have an appraisal contingency. Your agent can help navigate these negotiations.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Are older homes in Santa Clarita a good investment?',
      answer:
        'Older Santa Clarita homes (1970s-1980s) can offer excellent value with larger lots, mature landscaping, and established neighborhoods. However, factor in potential updates for HVAC, electrical, plumbing, and energy efficiency. Well-maintained older homes in desirable areas like Valencia and Saugus appreciate well due to location and limited inventory.',
